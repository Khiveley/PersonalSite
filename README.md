# Lessons Learned

I have had a fair amount of difficulty in getting my site hosted and the connection to continue.  I have changed the T2 instance in AWS from micro to large which allows for the content to be readily available.  Previously, additional pictures were available that no longer seem to be working; however, no links have changed.  I will continue to troubleshoot and determine why they no longer work.
