    <p>Thank you for viewing my portfolio site.  Above all else, I'm a father and husband.  My beautiful wife, Courtney, and I have been married since 2015.  We have 3 children: 2 girls and 1 boy.</p>

    <p>In my free time, I enjoy cooking and bread baking.  My culinary pursuits typically are cooking HelloFresh or simple weeknight meals, but I'm known for my smoked meats: pork shoulder, racks of ribs, and the occasional brisket. My baking tends more toward the rustic, particularly English and Italian country breads.</p>

    <p>I always strive to better myself and those around me.  I've had a broad spectrum of studies and careers, all of which have had a common thread: service.  I'm driven to help others and have done so both in client-facing and supporting roles. As a life long learner I'm open to learning new languages and technologies.  I hope to be part of a team that is well-established and values collaboration and contribution.  My background has been in finance and insurance but I'm very adaptable and willling to tackle challenges in unfamiliar territory.</p>

    <p>My group and I created a site "HelpingHand" to help fight hunger in through creating an app that allows users to create appointments for pickup of food at a food pantry.  Pantries can also post their inventory.  This also helps to ensure that front line workers can have improved safety from less time in contact.</p>

    <li><a href="https://github.com/Khiveley/EventTrackerProject" target="_blank">Event Tracker</a></li><br>
    <p>I created an event tracker called, "AfterBoot," which was designed as a study log to track my time in reference sources by language.  My ambitions are to hone my Java, JavaScript, and SQL skills as well as learn Python and possibly Unity/C#. </p>

    <li><a href="https://github.com/Khiveley/FinalProject" target="_blank">Final Project</a></li><br>
    <p>My group and I created a site to stave off boredom during quarantine and allow users to borrow from one another various forms of entertainment: books, movies, games, videogames, etc.</p>
